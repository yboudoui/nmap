/*
How it Works:

    Sends a SYN packet (like the beginning of a TCP handshake).
    If the port is open, the target responds with SYN-ACK.
    Instead of completing the handshake, Nmap sends an RST (Reset) packet to avoid detection.
    If the port is closed, the target sends an RST.
    If filtered, thereâ€™s no response or an ICMP unreachable message.
